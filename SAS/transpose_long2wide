* transpose from long to wide, see https://libguides.library.kent.edu/SAS/TransposeData; 
* 'by' determines the rows, 'id' de columns in the resulting transposed dataset;

* for long>wide: same values 'by' determine one row, different values of 'id' are distributed over the columns; 
proc sort data=_long;by  pat_id measurement;run;
proc transpose data=_long out=_wide;
    *variables that you want to copy along;
    copy var1 var2;
by pat_id; id measurement;
var value; *here the measurement value of pat_id at given measurement;
run;

* because the copy statement copies every record of the input (= long) to the output(=wide);
* but only copies the copy variables into the first record;
* we need to remove the 'empty' records;
data _wide; set _wide; 
if _name_ ne "";
run;
